# Hello-World

道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名。无名，万物之始也；有
名，万物之母也。故恒无欲也，以观其眇；恒有欲也，以观其所
徼。两者同出，异名同谓。玄之又玄，众眇之门。

It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. 
It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.  - Mark Twain

Remember that not all knowledges you know can solve every problems.
Try to look an alternate way when there is a bottle neck.
